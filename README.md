## What it does

- **Dashboard** — view your equity curve, daily PnL, drawdown, win rate, and profit factor across one or more accounts.
- **Calendar** — review each trading day: PnL, setups, trade count, and notes at a glance.
- **Journal** — log notes, setups, rules, and screenshots per trade or per day.
- **Prop firm tracking** — manage challenge phases, drawdown limits, profit targets, and payout eligibility.
- **Reports** — filter and export performance data by account, date range, symbol, or session.
- **Import/Export** — bring in trades via CSV or JSON; export your data at any time.
- **Goals** — set monthly targets (win rate, net PnL, etc.) and track progress.
- **AI insights** — optional GPT-powered weekly performance summaries.
- **Demo mode** — fully functional demo at `/demo` using local mock data, no login required.

## Getting started locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS (v20+)
- npm
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (free tier is enough for dev)
- PostgreSQL connection strings from Supabase

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Minimum variables needed to run locally:

```env
DATABASE_URL=             # Supabase pooled connection string (pgBouncer)
DIRECT_URL=               # Supabase direct connection string (for migrations)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=          # Any random 32+ character string
```

Everything else in `.env.example` (payments, AI, Sentry, etc.) is optional for local development.

### 3. Set up the database

Push the Drizzle schema to your Supabase project:

```bash
npm run db:generate   # generate migration files
npm run db:push       # apply schema to the database
```

You also need to apply the Supabase storage policies from `supabase/storage-policies.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.

### 4. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can use the app at `/demo` without any auth or DB.

## Useful commands

```bash
npm run dev              # start dev server (localhost:3000)
npm run type-check       # TypeScript check
npm run lint             # ESLint
npm test -- --run        # run Vitest tests once
npm run test:e2e         # Playwright end-to-end tests
npm run db:studio        # open Drizzle Studio to inspect the DB
npm run lint:fix         # auto-fix lint issues
```

## Project layout

```
app/                    # Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  (auth)/               # sign-in, sign-up, reset password
  dashboard/            # main app (requires auth)
  demo/                 # demo mode (no auth, all data is local mock)
  api/v1/               # REST API routes
components/             # shared React components
context/                # React context providers
hooks/                  # data-fetching hooks (TanStack Query, SWR)
lib/                    # utilities, analytics calculations, DB client
  db/                   # Drizzle schema and migrations
  demo/                 # mock data for demo mode
  security/             # CORS, origin validation, CSP helpers
public/                 # static assets, PWA manifest, service worker
tests/                  # Vitest unit tests and security tests
```

## Demo mode

Demo mode (`/demo`) runs entirely in the browser. A fetch interceptor (`app/demo/components/demo-network-interceptor.tsx`) catches all `/api/v1/*` calls and returns mock data. No database connection or auth token is needed.

## Security notes

- Never commit real secrets. Use `.env.local` for local development.
- All API routes are protected via Supabase session cookies. Row Level Security (RLS) is enforced at the database level.
- The `supabase/storage-policies.sql` file defines bucket access policies. Review and apply them before deploying.
- CORS is configured in `lib/security/origins.ts`. The production origin is `https://justjournalit.vercel.app`.
- A cron secret (`CRON_SECRET`) is required in production for scheduled maintenance jobs.
