          context-aware primary action — <strong>Sign In</strong> when no session is active, or
          <strong>Back to App</strong> (pointing to <code>/dashboard</code>) when a session exists.

          After authentication, the user enters the dashboard shell — the primary workspace for all
          trading analytics. The shell provides consistent navigation, global filters, and a command
          palette that follows the user across every page.

        <p>
          The Flutter mobile app mirrors the web dashboard's data model but uses a touch-optimized
          interface with bottom tab navigation. It connects to the same Supabase backend and shares
          the same PostgreSQL database, user-scoped row-level security, and real-time subscriptions.
