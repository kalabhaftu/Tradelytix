          <li><strong>Weekly Goals</strong> - Weekly targets (e.g., 10 trades with at least 40% win rate)</li>
          <li><strong>Monthly Goals</strong> - Monthly objectives (e.g., 5% return, max 5% drawdown)</li>
          <li><strong>Custom Goals</strong> - Define your own metric and target</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Goals are tracked automatically against your imported trade data:</p>

          <li>Each goal shows current progress as a percentage</li>
          <li>Visual progress bars show how close you are to each target</li>
          <li>Goals are filter-aware - they track against the same account filters as your dashboard</li>
          <li>Weekly and monthly goals reset at the configured intervals</li>
        </ul>
      </DocsSection>

      <DocsSection title="Goals in weekly review">
        <p>Your active goals are referenced in the weekly review report. The review shows which goals are on track, which need attention, and suggestions for adjustment.</p>

        <p>Goals are viewable on the mobile app. Check your goal progress from the Dashboard tab or the More menu.</p>
