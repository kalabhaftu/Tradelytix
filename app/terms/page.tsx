          <p>
            JJI (Just Journal It) provides trading analytics, journaling, reporting, and account-management tools. It is not financial advice, investment advice, tax advice, or a brokerage service. You are responsible for your trading decisions and for verifying any imported or calculated data before relying on it.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-foreground mb-4">Accounts and data</h2>
          <p>
            You are responsible for keeping your account secure and for the accuracy of the data you upload or enter. You may not use JJI to upload unlawful content, attack the service, bypass security controls, or access another user’s data.

          <p>
            You keep responsibility for the trades, notes, screenshots, and other content you submit. JJI gives you tools to export and delete data where those tools are available; keep your own backup of information you cannot afford to lose. Do not upload credentials, secrets, or material you do not have permission to use.

          <p>
            JJI is provided as-is. We work to keep it reliable and secure, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted access, perfect accuracy, or suitability for any specific trading strategy. To the maximum extent allowed by law, JJI is not liable for trading losses, lost profits, data-entry mistakes, import errors, or indirect damages.
